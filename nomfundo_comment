It is easy to read and understand your code.
There are some lines were I think you should consider adding explanation of your code to 
make someone that is not a coder be able to understand.
Your code is clean.
I'd suggest that you consider changing some colours for accomodating colour blind people,
colour blind people are unable to fully 'see' red or green.
